        Privacy Policy
        </h1>
        <p>Gathering consumer data is critical for every business. It helps aid the decision making process and allows companies to continuously improve consumer experience when they visit the website and decide to take an action. However, due to cyber crimes and data breach, consumers are skeptical about sharing their personal information on a website.</p>
        <p>Proton Technologies is a company that respects the need to maintain privacy of a consumer’s personal information. This privacy policy covers what, when, and how we collect and use a consumer’s personal information. It also covers a consumer’s rights to access that information.</p>
        <h3>Note:</h3>
        <p>The terms “we”, “our”, or “us” in the policy are used to refer Proton Technologies.
            <br />
            The terms “you” and “your” in the policy are used to refer to the consumers/visitors.
            <br />
            PII stands for Personally Identifiable Information.
            <br />
            Non-PII stands for Non-Personally Identifiable Information.
            <br />
            DNT stands for Do Not Track.
            <br />
            Please read this policy carefully!
        </p>
        <h3>Collection of Information:</h3>
        <p>Depending on how you interact with our website, we may need to collect PII. This may include but is not limited to your name, your contact information, email address, IP-based location, and shipping information. We may also collect non-PII, information not directly associated with you.</p>
        <h3>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</h3>
        <p>PII is collected when you use Protontechnologies.pk (creating an account, purchasing a product, signing up for our email newsletter/webinar/demo, participating in a conference call or attending an event, etc.) or when you call our team and give details over the phone to an employee or contractor of Proton Technologies.</p>
        <p>In addition, we may combine the PII and Non-PII we collect from you with additional information provided by third-parties (such as signing up for or linking a Google or Facebook account, or appending third party data). While we would never consciously collect or obtain data about our customers in an unethical manner, we will not be held responsible if we inadvertently obtain data from a third-party source that was collected in an unethical manner. However, if we learn that any third-party PII was collected unethically, we will cease using such data and will take steps to prevent its collection. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:hi@protontechnologies.com.pk">hi@protontechnologies.com.pk</a> if you think your PII was provided to or collected from a third-party in an unethical manner.</p>
        <h3>Finally, we will not collect your PII without your consent.</h3>
        <p>In case you wish for us to stop collecting your PII, simply contact us at <a href="mailto:hi@protontechnologies.com.pk">hi@protontechnologies.com.pk</a>. We will comply with customer DNT requests submitted through their web browsers pursuant to the state’s laws.</p>
        <h3>Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)</h3>
        <p>Certain Non-PII is automatically collected when you use our services. This information includes but is not limited to details about devices being used to avail services (Device’s IP address or numeric identifier of your mobile device) and about how you use Proton Technologies services (such as what time of day you visit our website). Our advertisers and ad servicers may also collect Non-PII outside Proton Technologies services to measure the success of our digital advertising campaigns. We use the Non-PII that we collect for a variety of purposes, these include providing and improving user experience and services, and to analyze and improve our advertising to provide the most relevant messages to our current and potential customers.</p>
        <h3>The Need to Collect PII and Non-PII?</h3>
        <p>The PII we collect is used to provide, analyze, and improve our services (e.g. process, offerings, respond to customer requests, make changes to current engagements, etc.) and to conduct marketing across print and digital mediums. If you willingly subscribe (“opt in”) to our email list, we will send you periodic emails about a variety of topics including, but not limited to: events, new content, product updates, blog content, company updates, employment opportunities, etc.</p>
        <p>We share email activity data with our marketing email provider (MailChimp) to help them better target our marketing emails to our customers. While our marketing email provider has access to email addresses and email activity and may share bulk/non-specific activity data (e.g. Non-PII), no email addresses, specific email actions, or other PII are ever shared with other third parties. Should a consumer wish to “opt out” of this sharing, that consumer simply needs to opt out of marketing email from us and will be promptly removed from all email lists. There is an Unsubscribe link in the bottom of each email we send out or you may contact Proton Technologies at <a href="mailto:hi@protontechnologies.com.pk">hi@protontechnologies.com.pk</a>.</p>
        <h3>Analytics, Advertising, and Digital Tools</h3>
        <p>Our website also uses third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics.</p>
        <p>Proton Technologies and our third-party vendors or partners use analytics data for a variety of purposes. These may include but are not limited to improving the design and content of our websites to help us learn things like what pages are most attractive to all of our visitors and what promotions visitors like to see, and to gauge the success of our advertising campaigns.</p>
        <p>In addition to Google Analytics, we use a number of data collection and advertising platforms and services that help us make informed decisions about our website’s layouts, content, offerings, and advertising.</p>
        <p>The PII we collect is not shared to third parties, except as follows. In all cases, you will be given notice and an opportunity to decide whether to share your PII:</p>
        <h3>The PII is only shared to/because</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Companies that provide services to us or perform functions on our behalf (such as processing credit card payments or taking orders) and have agreed to use your information only for the purposes we request</li>
            <li>For us to send offers to our customers on behalf of our affiliated companies and on behalf of other non-affiliated partners</li>
            <li>To other selected reputable companies, we may disclose your name and postal address (but not your email address or credit card information) so that they can mail you information that may interest you</li>
            <li>When we believe disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law, legal process, and/or governmental authorities;</li>
            <li>When we believe disclosure is necessary to enforce our privacy policy and other agreements, or to protect our rights, our customers, our property, our employees, or others;</li>
            <li>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, partial or total sale of assets, or other corporate change.</li>
            <li>For reasons mentioned previously in this Privacy Policy, we may disclose de-identified, aggregated, or other Non-PII to third parties.</li>
        </ul>
            <h3>The Right to Access Your Information</h3>

            <p>You can choose to decline communications from us at the point we request your PII. Or, after we have collected your PII, you can choose to stop our communications, or stop us from sharing your information with other companies for their marketing purposes.</p>

If you don’t want it to be public, please don’t post it to one of our social channels, on our website, or on third-party social media platforms. We will not be held responsible if others use the information you post in an unethical, obscene, or inappropriate way. If you do decide to post your information, be sure to check the privacy policies or terms of use of third-parties prior to posting on their platforms. Contact us at <a href="mailto:hi@protontechnologies.com.pk">hi@protontechnologies.com.pk</a> if you are unable to remove PII that you have posted to one of our social channels or website.</p>
